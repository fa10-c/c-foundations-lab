# C Foundations — Rebuild Lab 🛠️

A small, evolving lab dedicated to strengthening core C programming fundamentals through simple, focused exercises.

This repository is intentionally minimal. The goal is not complexity, but clarity — building solid mental models, clean reasoning, and confidence through consistent practice.

---

## Philosophy

- Keep it simple
- Understand before optimizing
- Small steps > big jumps
- Consistency over intensity
- Foundations first, complexity later

---

## What you’ll find here

This repo grows gradually and focuses on core building blocks:

- Basic logic, loops, and control flow
- Functions and decomposition
- Arrays and memory fundamentals
- Debugging habits and mental models
- Small, self-contained exercises
- Short notes capturing key insights and mistakes

Each piece is intentionally small and readable.

---

## Structure (current)

- `00-logic/` → basic logic, loops, and small functions
- `notes/` → concise learning notes and observations

More modules will be added over time as the lab evolves.

## Why this exists

Strong foundations make everything else easier.

This lab is a space to practice deliberately, refine fundamentals, and build deeper understanding step by step — without rush, without noise.

## Status

Work in progress.  
Built slowly, intentionally, and continuously.
