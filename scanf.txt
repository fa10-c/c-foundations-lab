🧩 What is scanf?

scanf = scan formatted input
It reads data from standard input (keyboard) and stores it into variables according to a format you specify.
If printf is:
“print formatted output”
Then scanf is:
“read formatted input”
Both live in the same library: #include <stdio.h>

🧠 Basic Idea

The simplest form:
scanf("format", &variable);
example:

int n;
scanf("%d", &n);

What this means:
%d → expect an integer
&n → give scanf the address of n so it can store the value there

Important:
scanf needs the address of the variable, not the variable itself.
That’s why we use &.

🔢 Common Format Specifiers:
| Specifier | Meaning             |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| `%d`      | int                 |
| `%ld`     | long                |
| `%f`      | float               |
| `%lf`     | double              |
| `%c`      | char                |
| `%s`      | string (char array) |


🧠 What Does scanf Return?

scanf returns the number of successfully assigned inputs.
Example:

int n;
int result = scanf("%d", &n);
If:
User types 42 → return value = 1
User types abc → return value = 0
Input stream ends (Ctrl+D) → return value = EOF (-1)
So proper validation looks like:
if (scanf("%d", &n) != 1)
This means:
“If I did not successfully read one integer, something is wrong.”

⚠️ Important Limitation #1 — Buffer Issues

If user types:
abc
scanf("%d", &n):
fails
returns 0

BUT leaves "abc" in the input buffer
If you try to scanf again without clearing the buffer, you may get stuck.
That’s why in more advanced programs people use:
fgets + strtol
instead of raw scanf.
But for beginner exercises, using scanf once and exiting is fine.

⚠️ Limitation #2 — Weak Validation

If user types:
12abc
scanf("%d", &n) will:
read 12
stop at a
return 1
So it partially accepts invalid input.
It doesn’t ensure the whole line is clean.

⚠️ Limitation #3 — Dangerous with Strings

If you do:
char s[10];
scanf("%s", s);
And the user types a 100-character string → buffer overflow.
You must limit input width like:
scanf("%9s", s);


🎯 When is scanf good?

Small console programs
Learning input basics
Quick interactive tools
Competitive programming
Controlled environments

🚫 When is it not ideal?

Secure applications
Robust CLI tools
Programs needing strict validation
Handling arbitrary user input safely
For those, fgets + strtol is better.

🧠 Mental Model Summary

scanf:

Reads text from keyboard
Matches it against your format string
Converts it into a typed value
Stores it in the variable you passed by address
Returns how many conversions succeeded
